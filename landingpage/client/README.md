What is the alpha launch?

The alpha launch is a program that buyananswer is running with the goal of creating content surrounding for users making their first steps in the crypto space.

We intend to create content for other users to understand the product and how they can start making money with it. We will use our alpha user base as partners to help us create content and help us improve the product.

Anyone who has a digital online presence can apply to be an alpha user. We will be looking for people who have a large following and can truly benefit from the digital transaction of answering questions.
