# BUY AN ANSWER (Web 3.0 Version)

The app is tool that anyone with social leverage can use to answer questions publically and recieve money. This is one step towards the true democratization of social capital. Someone with 400 followers might be able to answer 10 questions from their audience. Someone with 1,000,000 followers may want to answer 1000 questions. Essentially, it is a monetization channel in the creator economy. However, what is interesting is this monetization channel is completely public and built using the ethereum crypto currency. 

A spin on this is the website skipthequeue.io

This website is for live streamers that stream requests from their audience. You can add to the queue for $X.XX and you can check the number of skips currently on the queue. To skip the queue anyone will have to pay higher than the current skip.

Though this is a small internet niche, initially we aim to target around 1000 questions/skips/queues added. We believe that web 3.0 will grow expotentially in usage because of the political climate we are in (NYC, CPC, BTC -> balaji srinivasan).
