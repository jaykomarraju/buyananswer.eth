## BUYANANSWER.io
Building the digital transaction of answering a question
	
Buy An Answer is a web application that allows users to pay each other to answer questions. It could be simply asking your favorite recipe creator for tips on tweaking your grandma's recipe, getting on your favorite podcasters to talk about topics you care about, or a personal TikTok from your online finance guru answering your particular question. The medium of answering the question doesn’t really doesn’t matter. In a world where everyone is building social followings online, a tool to monetize this digital credibility is revolutionary in the knowledge-sharing creator economy.

We see that more and more people are working to build personal brands. More people are making money from the internet and more people are building their own digital social networks (1000 subscribers on YouTube; 2500 followers on LinkedIn; 5000 TikTok followers, Instagram, etc.). In a world filled with bots, online hate, etc., content creators who have built real followings but are not big enough to rely solely on ads need monetization channels. If these creators are in the knowledge space, they can benefit from a tool like this. These may be teachers, consultants, or, any other Subject Matter Experts (SMO). If we just assumed that a person from every single profession had 1000 people in their profession that were following them online, you can imagine that their networks probably would pay for advice/the person's opinion. Truly democratizing knowledge using capitalism.

Now let us sort of understand what the vision is. Will it just be a text transaction on a blockchain? No. We will not be text-only. We will initially launch as text, but soon we will build voice, and video - purely to scale globally, breaking language as a barrier. Our aim is to build a positive culture of valuing someone's time / insight / individuality / following online and creating online real person2person interactions. 

Why crypto? Isn’t that tanking? Well, this is WEB 3.0. A world of digital transactions at scale. Answer questions is just one of the many person2person digital transactions that will run on the web. The race over the next decade will be to establish as many credible person2person digital transactions as we can. Having said that, these transactions can be built using Stripe/Paypal/etc. But the reason we are picking crypto (particularly ETH) is this protects the sovereignty of the user. People can be canceled today if their opinions are against the mainstream. We stand for individual sovereignty. 

So now you know what we are and what we stand for, sign up today! We are live on the Ethereum blockchain. Though it is a beta, it is extremely secure (security/transparency is at the forefront of buyananswer.io).
